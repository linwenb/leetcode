/*
The set [1,2,3,â€¦,n] contains a total of n! unique permutations.

By listing and labeling all of the permutations in order,
We get the following sequence (ie, for n = 3):

"123"
"132"
"213"
"231"
"312"
"321"
Given n and k, return the kth permutation sequence.

Note: Given n will be between 1 and 9 inclusive.

        1. divide the solution set into 4 groups: "1xxx", "2xxx", "3xxx", and "4xxx", while each group has 3! = 6 members.
            From 21/6 = 3, we know that the 21th element is in the 3th group
        2. divide it into 3 sub-groups again: "41xx", "42xx" and "43xx", and each group has 2!=2 members.
            calculate 3/2 and get 1, so it's the 1st element of 1th sub-group - "421x"
        3. and so on
